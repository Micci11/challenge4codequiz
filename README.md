1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to save the code.

2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

    -sh

# Usage

To use the API Code Quiz application, open the index.html file in your web browser by double-clicking on it or dragging it to the browser window. You should see the home page of the quiz, which explains the rules and prompts you to start the quiz by clicking on the "Start Quiz" button.

Once you click on the "Start Quiz" button, the timer will start counting down from the allocated time (e.g., 60 seconds) and the first question will appear. You'll have to select one of the multiple-choice answers by clicking on the corresponding button, and then click on the "Next" button to move to the next question. If you select the correct answer, you'll get some points added to your score; otherwise, you'll get no points, and some time will be subtracted from the timer.

If you reach the end of the quiz before the timer runs out, you'll see a summary page that shows your final score and prompts you to enter your name to save your score to the high scores list. You can also clear the high scores or go back to the home page by clicking on the corresponding buttons.

If the timer runs out before you finish the quiz, you'll see a time's up message and be redirected to the home page. You can try the quiz again by clicking on the "Try Again" button.
